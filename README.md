Zerocash Core 
=====================================

This is a source code dump of code for a fork of the Bitcoin codebase made to use Zerocash. 

At the moment, it is incomplete, does not build without manual changes to generated config files,  and should not be trusted for doing anything. Even if you do get it to build, there is no wallet.  It is prototype code intended for getting numbers in a paper, it was never finished, didn't work well for even those purposes, and was never intended to see the light of day, much less be used without massive cleanup that we have not yet done.  THE MODIFICATIONS TO BITCOIN MADE HERE SHOULD BE ASSUMED TO BE TOTALLY INSECURE.

There are others working on using this as a starting point and we are working with them. There is a large amount of work left.  However, we committed to open sourcing this version , so here.
